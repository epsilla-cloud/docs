# âœˆ Roadmap

We're thrilled to present a comprehensive overview of the features and projects we're planning to develop. We're eager to engage with our community and users to shape the priority of these initiatives. We value your input, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts with us.

* **JavaScript/TypeScript Library**: A library to interact EpsillaDB with JavaScript/TypeScript.
* **CLI with SQL-style Syntax**: A new command-line interface is in the works, featuring a syntax similar to SQL for intuitive, straightforward commands.
* **Integration Support**: We're developing integrations with LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI plugin, AutoGPT, and others.
* **Built-in Embedding Support**: We aim to streamline your workflow by enabling document embedding directly within EpsillaDB, eliminating the need for pre-insertion embedding.
* **Multi-modal Document Support**: EpsillaDB is expanding to support a variety of document formats, including images, audio, video, and more.
* **Comprehensive DBMS Features**: We're committed to enhancing our database management system features to provide you with a powerful, flexible tool for managing your data.
* **Serverless Cloud Offering**: A consumption-based pricing model is on the horizon, bringing you the flexibility of a serverless cloud solution akin to DynamoDB for vector search.
* **Enterprise Readiness Features**: We're implementing robust enterprise readiness features, such as a distributed vector engine, high availability, access control, integrated authentication and authorization, and observability, amongst others.
* **Embedding Visualization**: To give you more insight into your data, we're working on a feature that visualizes embeddings directly within EpsillaDB.

Your insights are integral to our development journey. We're looking forward to hearing your thoughts on these proposed features and initiatives.
