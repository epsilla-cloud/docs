# Embeddings

Embeddings/vectors are numerical representations of complex data like text or images in a format that machines can process. Embedding models convert text, images, audios, and videos into vectors of real numbers. This process captures semantic meaning, allowing algorithms to understand content similarity and context. This technique is pivotal in various applications, from Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to recommendation systems to language translation, as it enables computers to 'understand' and work with human language.
