  In Epsilla, you can have multiple tables in a database. A table has its name,
  and multiple fields. Each field has its name, data type, and specific
  configurations.

# Create a new table

## Create a table using Epsilla Docker

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
status_code, response = db.create_table(
    table_name="MyTable",
    table_fields=[
        {"name": "ID", "dataType": "INT", "primaryKey": True},
        {"name": "Doc", "dataType": "STRING"},
        {"name": "Embedding", "dataType": "VECTOR_FLOAT", "dimensions": 4}
    ]
)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
await db.createTable('MyTable',
  [
    {"name": "ID", "dataType": "INT", "primaryKey": true},
    {"name": "Doc", "dataType": "STRING"},
    {"name": "Embedding", "dataType": "VECTOR_FLOAT", "dimensions": 4}
  ]
);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Create a table on Epsilla Cloud

For now, you can create vector tables via Cloud GUI. Use the 'Add' button to add more fields; Use the 'Delete' icon to remove a field; Give each field a name, data type, and additional options.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will support creating tables via Python/JavaScript client in the near future.
{% endhint %}

## Field Data Types

We can define different data types for each field. Here are supported data types:

```
TINYINT      # An int with value range [-256, 255]
SMALLINT     # An int with value range [-65536, 65535]
INT          # An int with value range [-2147483648, 2147483647]
BIGINT       # An int with value range [-9223372036854775808, 9223372036854775807]
FLOAT        # A float field
DOUBLE       # A double field
STRING       # A string field
BOOL         # A boolean field
JSON         # Any valid JSON
VECTOR_FLOAT # A vector of float field, dimension must be provided
```

### Embedding Fields

Epsilla supports defining multiple embedding fields in one table. This is very convenient for you to manage multiple embeddings (could be embedded from different models) for the same documents.&#x20;

For an embedding field, you need to provide a dimension parameter, which specifies how many numbers are stored in each vector. This number needs to be consistent with the embedding model that you are using to embed the raw data.

### Metric Type

When you specify an embedding field, you can also designate a metric type for the embedding model. The metric types supported currently are **Euclidean** and **Cosine**. Hereâ€™s a brief on the benefits of each metric type:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
...
    table_fields=[
        ...
        {
            "name": "Embedding",
            "dataType": "VECTOR_FLOAT",
            "dimensions": 4,
            "metricType": "COSINE"
        }
    ]
...
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
...
  [
    ...
    {
      "name": "Embedding",
      "dataType": "VECTOR_FLOAT",
      "dimensions": 4,
      "metricType": "COSINE"
    }
  ]
...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### **Euclidean**:

* **Intuitive**: The Euclidean distance is straightforward and intuitive as it's the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in space. This can be beneficial in applications where interpretability is important.
* **Geometry Preserving**: It preserves the geometric structure of the data, making it suitable for applications where the geometric relationships between data points are significant.

#### **Cosine**:

* **Angle-Based Similarity**: Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the angle between vectors is more important than their absolute magnitudes. For instance, in text analysis, cosine similarity can capture the orientation of documents in the vector space irrespective of their length.
* **Normalization**: Cosine similarity inherently accounts for magnitude, making it useful in scenarios where data is normalized or needs to be comparable on a similar scale. Note: when using Cosine metric for embedding field, Epsilla will automatically normalize the vector (i.e., rescale the vector length to 1.0) before storing it.

In Epsilla, if the metric type is not specified, the system defaults to using the Euclidean metric. This setting may be more suitable for general-purpose embedding applications, while the Cosine metric might be more appropriate for specialized or domain-specific applications.

### Primary Key

Optionally, you can define one field of a table as the primary key. By defining primary key, Epsilla will automatically conduct duplication check, and reject records that have a primary key value that already exists in the table. The primary key field has to be one of the following data types:

```
TINYINT
SMALLINT
INT
BIGINT
STRING
```
