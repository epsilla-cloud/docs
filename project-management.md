# Project Management

In Epsilla, we use projects to organize resources (AI agents, knowledge bases, evaluations, integrations, etc.) into groups and grant access to different users.

When a new user registers at Epsilla, we create a default project for them. Free Tier and Starter Tier users can have only one project. Professional Tier users can have up to ten projects, while Enterprise Tier users can have unlimited projects.&#x20;

You can switch between projects at the top of the left navigation bar:

Click the **Create New Project** button from the dropdown, and you will be prompted to create a new project. You can give the project a name and configure which team members in your organization will have access to it.

Please save the API key before proceeding. The API key will be your way to programmatically interact with all resources in this project. This is the only time you will see the API key. If you miss this opportunity, you will need to create a new API key later.
{% endhint %}

Click the **Settings** button to the right of the Projects dropdown, and you will enter the Project Management page to manage the current project:

Here, you can change the project name, grant or revoke access to team members, and manage API keys:
