### **Fill in Test Case Details**

There will be one empty test case created by default. Fill in test case details.

**Question**: Input the query or task you want the AI agent to handle. For example, “What was the cumulative total return for Meta Platforms, Inc. at the end of 2022 compared to its peak value during the five-year period ending December 31, 2023?”

**Expected Answer**: Input the correct answer that the AI agent is expected to provide. For example, “The cumulative total return for Meta Platforms, Inc. at the end of 2022 was 90, which is significantly lower compared to its peak value of 275 at the end of 2023.”

### **Add Test Cases**

You want to create a set of test cases that can be repeatedly executed during AI agent updates, so that we can be confident our configuration changes don't introduce regression.

Click the **Add Test Case** button to input questions and expected answers for your evaluation. A new row will be added for each test case, with columns for **Question**, **Expected Answer** for you to fill in same as above.
