If any of these resources are nearing their maximum capacity, you can easily upgrade your plan by selecting the **Upgrade** button on the page. This ensures continued access to all features without interruptions.

### **Invoices**

The billing page also provides a comprehensive invoice history. You can view details such as the date the invoice was created, the amount billed, and the payment status (e.g., **Succeeded**). You can download individual invoices by clicking the download icon next to each entry for record-keeping.
